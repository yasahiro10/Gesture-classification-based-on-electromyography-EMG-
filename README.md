Title: Gesture Classification Using Electromyography (EMG)

Description:

This GitHub repository focuses on the implementation of gesture classification using Electromyography (EMG) signals. Electromyography is a technique that records the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles during contraction. In the context of gesture classification, EMG signals are utilized to capture muscle activity patterns associated with specific hand or limb movements.

Key Features:

Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Explanation of the process of collecting EMG data using sensors or electrodes placed on the skin.
Preprocessing techniques to clean and enhance the raw EMG signals, including filtering and noise reduction.
Feature Extraction:

Implementation of algorithms for extracting relevant features from the preprocessed EMG signals.
Description of feature sets commonly used for gesture classification, such as time-domain features, frequency-domain features, and time-frequency features.
Gesture Classification Models:

Implementation of machine learning and/or deep learning models for classifying gestures based on EMG signals.
Comparative analysis of different classification algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest and XGbooster.
Training and Evaluation:

Guidelines for training the gesture classification models using labeled EMG datasets.
Metrics for evaluating the performance of the models, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
